JavaSE
======

Java SE examples and applications only for test purposes.
This repository contains just examples and code snippets with educational purposes and no one have full functionality.
Here I'm covering concepts from Java SE for newbies, like Object and Class Concepts, Object Orientation topics like polimorphism, 
inheritance, encapsulating fields and so on, to more advanced concepts, like JDBC, GUI with Swing, Generics, Collections, 
Enums, Threads and so on.
