JavaEE
======

Java EE examples and applications only for test purposes.
This repository contains just examples and code snippets with educational purposes and no one have full functionality.
Here I'm covering concepts from Java EE for newbies to more advanced concepts.
Starting with simple JSP examples, going through Servlets, and moving forward to frameworks like Struts, JSF and Spring, 
in order to show how the different JavaEE technologies works.
